           For the last five years or so, I have been working
        as an Interior Designer and Interior Architect. While
        I absolutely loved my work and the variety that came with
        it; I wanted better job prospects and longevity in the future.
        I decided that pursuing a career in tech might just be the answer
        I was looking for. In college, I had an interest in web development,
        but didn't know how to go about pursuing it. I am excited to see
        where this new journey takes me.

            When I'm not studying or working, I love to hike and travel with
            my sister. We are currently working our way through all of the National
            Parks. On our most recent trip, we visited Zion National Park in Utah. 
            We also won a lottery to hike The Wave in the Coyote Buttes in Arizona.

            Another pastime of mine, is training my dog. I have a 2 year old Border 
            Collie, named Gadget, that I am training to be our hiking partner. I 
            also hope that he will become an agility competitor. He's full of energy
            and smarter than me, which definitely keeps me on my toes.
